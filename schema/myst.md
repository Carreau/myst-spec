# Myst mdast

This schema defines the Myst Abstract Syntax Tree. The nodes in this syntax tree are [unist](./unist/unist.md) nodes and extend the existing [mdast](./commonmark/commonmark.md) commonmark syntax.

The Myst mdast specification extends this existing work by adding Myst-specific nodes including: roles, directives, figure targets / references, citations, and document-level metadata and blocks.
